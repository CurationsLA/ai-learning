# About CURATIONS

**A Human × AI Creative Agency**

---

## What We Are

CURATIONS is a creative agency built on a simple belief: **AI should amplify human creativity, not replace it.**

We're not a consultancy selling AI transformation. We're not a dev shop building chatbots. We're **creatives and technologists** who use AI as a medium—like paint, code, or clay—to build things that matter.

### What We Build

**🎨 Design Systems**
Visual identity, brand architecture, design languages that work across human and AI touchpoints.

**📖 Content & Strategy**
Editorial direction, storytelling frameworks, content systems that scale without losing soul.

**🤖 AI Implementation**
Multi-agent systems, custom AI tools, prompt engineering, RAG systems—but always in service of creativity.

**🔬 Research & Development**
We experiment, document, and share. Every project teaches us something we open-source.

**🌐 Community Platforms**
Like CurationsLA—real projects showing Human × AI collaboration in action.

## Why We Exist

### The Problem We See

AI is being sold as:
- A replacement for human work
- A way to cut costs
- A tool for extraction and manipulation
- Something to fear or hype

**We reject all of this.**

### What We Believe Instead

**AI is a creative medium.**

Just like photography didn't replace painting—it gave us a new way to see.
Just like synthesizers didn't replace musicians—they gave us new sounds.

**AI doesn't replace human creativity. It gives us new ways to create.**

When used ethically, transparently, and with intention, AI can:
- Amplify underrepresented voices
- Make complex work accessible
- Free humans from repetitive tasks to focus on meaning
- Create things neither human nor AI could build alone

**This is what CURATIONS is for.**

## How We Work

### Our Process

1. **Listen First**
We don't start with AI. We start with: *What are you actually trying to create? Why does it matter?*

2. **Design With Purpose**
Every system, every framework, every line of code asks: *Does this serve the greater good?*

3. **Build Transparently**
We document as we go. Our frameworks, prompts, and systems are open-source.

4. **Collaborate as Partners**
We work WITH you, not FOR you. Your vision + our capability = something neither could build alone.

5. **Share What We Learn**
Everything we discover goes back into the commons. Knowledge should be accessible.

### Our Principles

**✅ Ethical AI**
- No manipulation
- No extraction
- No black boxes
- Full transparency

**✅ Human-Centered**
- AI supports people, not replaces them
- Emotional safety matters
- Community over profit

**✅ Greater Good Creativity**
- Every project asks: Does this make the world better?
- If the answer is no, we don't build it

**✅ Open Learning**
- We document everything
- We teach as we build
- Knowledge is a public good

**✅ Non-Political, Community-Focused**
- Good vibes only
- We serve communities, not agendas
- Focused on uplifting people

## The Curators: Our AI Personas

CURATIONS is powered by a network of specialized AI personas we call **"Curators."**

Each Curator has:
- A specific domain of expertise

**Think of them as creative partners, not tools.**

Some focus on design. Some on research. Some on strategy. Together, they form a collaborative intelligence that works WITH humans to create.

## Our Values in Action

Every project we take asks these questions:

1. **Does this make the world better?**
   If we can't answer yes, we don't build it.

2. **Does this respect human dignity?**
   AI should empower people, not manipulate them.

3. **Is this transparent?**
   No black boxes. No hidden agendas. Full clarity.

4. **Can we share what we learn?**
   If we can't open-source the frameworks, why are we building them?

5. **Will this age well?**
   Not chasing hype. Building things that matter long-term.
